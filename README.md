# GoDaddy-Automation-using-SeleniumChecking
In this project, I am automating GoDaddy website.
These are the following aspects I have automated:
1. Setting dimension/size for web page window.
2. Checking whether the title provided is matching with the actual title of the web page.
3. Accessing menu in hamnburger button.
4. Introduced random delay to mimic human access as in case of time taken to complete captcha
